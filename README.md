# Tree_simulation_game_of_life
A simple simulation used to investigate steady-state in 'game of life' style. The code creates a 2d map of trees in a grid, and sets them as one of three states: alive, dead, or on fire. To create a steady state, adjacent trees to a tree on fire would catch alight. Also included is a method of animation.
